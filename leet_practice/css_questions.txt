1. What Is A CSS Reset?
A CSS Reset (or “Reset CSS”) is a short, often compressed (minified) set of CSS rules that resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline.
Using a CSS Reset, CSS authors can force every browser to have all its styles reset to null, thus avoiding cross-browser differences as much as possible.

Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

   A child combinator in CSS is the "greater than" symbol
   It means "select elements that are direct descendants only". In this case: "select list items that are direct descendants of an ordered list". To illustrate:

<ol>
  <li>WILL be selected</li>
  <li>WILL be selected</li>
  <ul>
     <li>Will NOT be selected</li>
     <li>Will NOT be selected</li>
  </ul>
  <li>WILL be selected</li>
</ol>
